# INPE scintillation data example

This is an example data for the papers:

* Sun, K. A., Pi, X., Rino, C., & Lee, J. (2022). Statistical Uncertainty in the frequency dependence of the intensity scintillation index (S4). *Space Weather*, (Submitted)

## Description of the data

The data was obtained from Septentrio PolaRxS Pro GNSS receiver and processed to MAT-file.

### Variables

```
INPE_refined.mat

column 1 U (scattering strength)
column 2 p (one-component phase spectral index)
column 3 fF (Fresnel frequency)
column 4 S4(f_L1) with a 30-min window
column 5 S4(f_L2) with a 30-min window
column 6 S4(f_L1) with a 1-min window
column 7 S4(f_L2) with a 1-min window

```
